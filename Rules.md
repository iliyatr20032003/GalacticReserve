# Durak Rules

Durak is a classic Russian card game played with a 36‑card deck. The goal is to avoid being the last player holding cards.

## Setup
1. Shuffle and deal six cards to each player.
2. Reveal the bottom card of the deck – its suit becomes trump.
3. Player with the lowest trump begins the attack.

## Turn
1. **Attack**: Attacker plays one card to the table.
2. **Defence**: Defender must beat the attacking card with a higher card of the same suit or any trump.
3. **Resolution**:
   - If the attack is beaten, cards move to the discard pile and roles rotate.
   - Otherwise the defender takes all cards on the table and roles stay.
4. **Refill**: Starting with the attacker, players draw from the deck back up to six cards.

When the deck is empty, hands simply shrink. The last player left with cards is the Durak (fool).
